problem statement:
In the era of increasing reliance on touchless interaction, the need for intuitive human-computer interfaces is paramount. This project aims to develop a real-time hand gesture recognition system using a web camera and a custom-trained image classification model. The system will recognize and classify various hand gestures, such as "thumbs up," "thumbs down," "peace sign," and "open palm," enabling seamless interaction without physical contact.
The objectives include:

Data Collection: Create a comprehensive dataset by capturing at least 200-300 images per gesture under diverse lighting conditions and hand positions, organized into distinct folders for each gesture category.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected images to enhance model performance, including resizing, normalization, and optional background isolation using techniques like edge detection with OpenCV.

Model Implementation: Implement a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or leverage transfer learning using a pre-trained model such as MobileNet or VGG16, training it on the collected dataset for effective gesture classification.

Real-time Gesture Recognition: Utilize OpenCV to establish a live video feed from the web camera, applying the trained model to predict gestures in real time, and displaying the results directly on the video stream.

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using a validation set, calculating accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, along with visualizing training and validation accuracy/loss curves.

Custom Features: Introduce additional functionalities, such as tracking gestures over time, counting occurrences, and enabling user interactions through specific gestures (e.g., raising a hand to pause a video).

By addressing these components, the project seeks to create an effective and user-friendly hand gesture recognition system that can enhance interactive experiences across various applications, including gaming, remote control, and accessibility tools.

Brief approach

The approach to developing a hand gesture recognition system involves several structured steps. First, set up a project directory that organizes data, models, and scripts efficiently. Next, implement a data collection script to capture images of various hand gestures using a webcam, ensuring at least 200-300 images per gesture are collected. Following this, preprocess the images by resizing and normalizing them, saving the processed data in NumPy format for training. Then, create a training script that utilizes a pre-trained model, such as MobileNetV2, to classify the gestures based on the processed dataset, saving the trained model for later use. To enable real-time recognition, develop a script that captures live video from the webcam and predicts gestures using the trained model, displaying results directly on the video feed. Finally, maintain a requirements file to manage dependencies and a README for setup instructions and usage guidelines. This structured approach ensures a modular workflow, making the system easier to update and maintain.
